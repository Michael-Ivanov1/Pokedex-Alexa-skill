Hey Y'all welcome to my Pokedex Alexa Skill!

If you look at my code you'll see that I have two files which are compatible with connecting to Amazon Alexa. The Alexa_framework.py file works with a custom ngrok https server to establish a connection to Alexa and it uses the Flask-Ask library. The ASK_SDK.py file is, like its name suggests, using the ASK_SDK library, which is native to the Alexa skill portal and has a lambda connection through the Alexa Developer portal itself. 

Browse away!
